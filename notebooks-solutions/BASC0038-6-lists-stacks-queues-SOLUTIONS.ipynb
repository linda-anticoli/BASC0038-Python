        "So far, we have focused on the concept of an algorithm, which could concisely be described as a method to solve a problem. Now, we will move on to consider data structures, that is, how data is actually stored and manipulated. We will begin to appreciate that these complementary notions are effectively equivalent; for example, heapsort is simply equivalent to using a data structure known as a heap, and under the hood a heap uses what could accurately be described as algorithms to accomplish certain tasks, which are performed upon data laid out in memory in a certain way etc.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "Terminology in this area often becomes overloaded and contradictory. We will distinguish between *data structures* and *abstract data types* (ADTs), although such definitions are quite mutable. *Data structures* refer to how data is actually laid out and manipulated in memory, whereas *abstract data types* refer to conceptual collections (e.g. lists, stacks and queues) which can be implemented using often a variety of different data structures.\r\n",

        "Consider some type of elements we may want to store in a list, such as an integer. Let us assume our architecture lets us possess 32-bit (unsigned) integers; that is, 32 consecutive bits in memory understood to represent overall some value ranging from $0$ to $2^{32}=4294967296$.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "What if we would like to store a list of, say, five of these integers? The easiest approach would be to store these consecutively in memory. We could possess a pointer to the first element, and look 32 bits ahead in order to obtain the second element, and another 32 bits ahead to obtain the third element etc.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "A memory block of contiguous elements is known as an *array*, the most fundamental way of implementing a list. A key benefit of arrays is its efficiency of indexing; that is, obtaining the element at *any* given index can be done in $O(1)$ time. In the example of 32-bit integers, if you have a pointer in terms of bits to the first (`0`th) object, called `head`, a pointer to the `i`th object is simply `head + i*32`.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "A related benefit is its inherent space-efficiency; that is, all of the elements are stored in one place, as compactly as possible (without entering the topic of compression, of course). The downside to this is that inserting a new element is an $O(n)$ operation, because an array of length `n` must be moved into newly-allocated memory of size `n+1`.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "A *dynamic array* will move the array into more memory than is needed when inserting an element. For example, let's say we are inserting an element at the end of the list. A growth factor of 2 means that an array of length `n` is moved in $O(n)$ time into newly-allocated memory of size `2*n`, meaning that there are now `n-1` empty spaces at the end of the array, such that the next `n-1` end-insertions do not require reallocation and can thus be done in $O(1)$. By continually doubling the capacity of the array, the capacity grows exponentially, meaning that for arbitrarily large $n$, the probability of an end-insertion requiring $O(1)$ time asymptotically dominates the probability it requires $O(n)$. Therefore, we say the *amortised* time complexity of this operation is $O(1)$.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "However, inserting an element into any other position than the end is still $O(n)$, because all elements after that position must be shifted in order to make room. Removal from the end is trivially $O(1)$ even for a simple array, but likewise $O(n)$ for any other position for the same reasons as insertion.\r\n",
