For example, bubble sort (and its variations such as cocktail shaker sort, combsort etc.) can be categorised as sorting by exchange, as the fundamental technique is in repeatedly exchanging elements. Quicksort would also be classed as sorting by exchange for similar reasoning (hence why it sometimes referred to as *partition-exchange sort*).\r\n",

In terms of complexity, there is $O(n)$ operations due to selecting elements one-by-one, and for each of those there is an extra $O(n)$ operations in order to determine the next element to select, as it simply compares all remaining elements, giving $O(n^2)$ overall.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "What if we could determine the largest/smallest of $n$ elements more efficiently than $O(n)$? Substituting this method into selection sort could then result in an overall compexity better than $O(n^2)$. As it happens, we can indeed perform selection more efficiently than $O(n)$; one way of doing this effectively is with a *heap* data structure."

        "Inserting an element into a heap (commonly referred to as the *push* operation for data structures) is a two stage process. First, the element to push is merely appended to the array, which is equivalent to adding it in the next unfilled position as a child on the bottom level of the binary tree. Then, the heap must be re-balanced to ensure the heap property is maintained by swapping elements. This latter step is referred to as the *sift-up* operation.\r\n",

        "\r\n",
        "In the best case, the inserted value should remain a leaf node (i.e. a node with no children) so no swapping is needed and insertion is constant-time. In the average case, you might expect insertion to be logarithmic-time as with the worst case, but in fact it is also constant-time. The qualitative reasoning for this is that half of the nodes in the tree are leaves, so in the average case the probability that an inserted node should also go on the bottom level is $1/2$. Then, the probability that it should go on the bottom-but-one level is $1/4$, and so on and so forth, which is a converging series and can be used to derive constant-time bounding overall."

        "1.   Instead of initialising an empty heap and pushing each element into it, treat the array `start` to `end` as given as a broken max heap and restore the heap property.\r\n",

        "3.   Repeat by swapping the new first element into the second-to-last position. The sorted sublist builds up from the end. Sift down the new root element to fix the heap `start` to `end-2`.\r\n",
        "4.   Repeat until the heap is reduced to only the first element, which is necessarily the smallest. Thus, the array is sorted.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "In point 1, an arbitrary array of values is 'heapified' by calling sift-down on every non-leaf node from the bottom-up. This works by considering subtrees. That is, the subtrees rooted with every leaf are already heaps, as they are just single nodes. Then, sifting down each node on the next level up turns each of the subtrees rooted in those nodes into a heap. This is repeated moving up level by level until, finally, the root value itself is sifted down to finish heapifying the entire tree.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "So, the array is heapified in-place by repeated sift-down operations, then the root is continually popped into a sorted sublist in the back of the array. In terms of complexity, consider again that an individual insertion by sift-up is $O(\\log{n})$ in the worst case and $O(1)$ in the average case, such that building a heap by one-by-one insertion is $O(n\\log{n})$ in the worst case and $O(n)$ in the average case. By instead heapifying in-place by repeated sift-downs, this is improved to $O(n)$ *in the worst case*. The intuitive reasoning for this is, again, similar to that dicussed in the analysis of sift-up and sift-down: sifting-down a node naturally takes fewer operations the lower down that node is, and most of the nodes in the tree are found in the lower levels.\r\n",
