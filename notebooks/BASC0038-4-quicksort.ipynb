        "We have seen that quicksort outperforms mergesort in the average case. However, quicksort's quadratic worst-case complexity is a significant issue. Luckily, it is relatively easy to avoid the worst case by a more intelligent choice of pivot.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "Note that the worst case occurs when the input array is already sorted, if quicksort always uses the last (or equivalently first) element as the pivot. The input already begin sorted or nearly-sorted is not uncommon, so this is particularly unfortunate. Understand and try implementing as a variation of your above code the following possible fixes:\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "*   ***Middle***: Pick the middle index as the pivot. This turns an already-sorted input from the worst case into the best case.\r\n",
        "*   ***Randomised quicksort***: Randomly select any index as the pivot each time.\r\n",
        "*   ***Median-of-three***: Look at the first, middle and last elements in the list, and select their median as the pivot.\r\n",
        "*   ***Psuedomedian-of-nine***: Divide the list into thirds and take the median-of-three of each third. Then, take the median of those three medians ans select it as the pivot."
